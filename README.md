## Usage

### Automatic Posting

Once configured, the plugin will automatically post to Threads whenever you publish a new blog post. The plugin will:

1. Take your post title and content
2. Check if it fits within Threads' 500 character limit
3. If too long, truncate the content and add a shortened URL
4. Post to your Threads account
5. Mark the post as "posted" to prevent duplicates

### Manual Posting

To post existing blog posts:

1. Go to **Settings â†’ WordPress to Threads**
2. Scroll down to **Manual Post to Threads**
3. You'll see a table of your recent posts with their status
4. Click **Post to Threads** next to any unposted content
5. Watch for success/error messages

### Post Status Indicators

- âœ… **Posted**: The post has been shared to Threads
- ðŸŸ  **Not posted**: The post hasn't been shared yet

## Character Limit Handling

Threads has a 500 character limit. The plugin handles this intelligently:

1. **Short posts**: Posted as-is with title and content
2. **Long posts**: Content is truncated and a Bitly link is added
3. **Very long titles**: Title is truncated if needed to fit the URL

Example of a truncated post:
```
My Amazing Blog Post Title

This is the beginning of my blog post content that gets truncated when it's too long...

https://bit.ly/abc123
```

## Settings

### Enable Auto Posting
Enable or disable automatic posting when blog posts are published.

### Threads App ID
Your App ID from Meta for Developers.

### OAuth Authorization
Shows authorization status and provides authorize/deauthorize buttons.

## API Endpoints

The plugin creates these endpoints for OAuth compliance:

- `/?threads_oauth_action=redirect` - OAuth callback
- `/?threads_oauth_action=deauthorize` - Remove authorization
- `/?threads_oauth_action=data_deletion` - GDPR data deletion

## Troubleshooting

### Authorization Issues

**Problem**: "Failed to authorize" error
**Solution**: 
- Check your App ID and App Secret are correct
- Verify redirect URLs are configured in Meta app settings
- Ensure your domain matches exactly (including www/non-www)

### Posting Issues

**Problem**: Posts not appearing on Threads
**Solution**:
- Check error logs in WordPress (Tools â†’ Site Health â†’ Info â†’ WordPress Constants â†’ WP_DEBUG_LOG)
- Verify your authorization is still valid
- Try re-authorizing the plugin

### Character Limit Issues

**Problem**: Posts are getting cut off unexpectedly
**Solution**:
- The plugin accounts for URLs in the character count
- Very long titles may be truncated to fit the Bitly link
- Consider shorter, more concise post titles
